`(SELECT first_name FROM actor)
UNION
(SELECT first_name FROM customer);`

- List the common (intersecting) values from the first_name columns in both the actor and customer tables.<br>
`(SELECT first_name FROM actor)
INTERSECT
(SELECT first_name FROM customer);`

- List the first_name values that exist in the actor table but do not exist in the customer table.<br>
`(SELECT first_name FROM actor)
EXCEPT
(SELECT first_name FROM customer);`

- Repeat the above three queries, but include duplicate values as well.<br>
  - To be able to see duplicate values just add ALL after UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
